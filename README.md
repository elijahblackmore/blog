# Blog

This repository houses the source code for my personal blog, where I will
occasionally post some of my ramblings.

This blog is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), using the
[Unified.js](https://unifiedjs.com) ecosystem to assist in manipulating Markdown
content.

The blog posts are stored in the [`posts`](posts) directory at the root of this
repository, where each post is a Markdown file using
[YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) as metadata that
can be parsed.

So I have finally created my own blog to dump my various ramblings. This project
has been on my mind for a while now, so I'm glad to announce that I took the
plunge, and it's currently in a state where I feel comfortable going public.

A big motivation for creating this space was a saying that has always stuck with
me:

> The best way to learn something; is to teach it.

I totally agree with this philosophy. Not only does it force you to understand
the topic at hand, but it's a great way to solidify your knowledge as you
lecture, and also receive potential feedback.

Whilst I'm not directly teaching here, it does push me to better understand
whatever it is that I'm writing about, and I hope some of these posts can serve
as a learning resource to anyone out there.

I haven't thought too much about how I'm going to structure this, or whether
I'll stick to any form of schedule, but I'm really excited to see where it goes.
These upcoming posts will likely consist of things that I'm currently learning
about, tools or workflows that I find interesting, or perhaps something that I'm
proud of.

I've made the source code for this website available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/elijahblackmore/blog), under the
[MIT License](https://github.com/elijahblackmore/blog/blob/main/LICENSE). Please
feel free to use it as you wish, but note that I'm learning as I go.

Stay safe out there.
